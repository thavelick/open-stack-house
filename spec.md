## **1. Overview**

**Open Stack House** is a web-based, retro-style, low-resolution puzzle game where players control a Mario-like character who can jump to pick up and place numbered blocks. The objective is to merge blocks of the same number to achieve higher numbers and accumulate the highest possible score before the playfield fills up or a block lands on the player. The game emphasizes simple mechanics, strategic block placement, and increasing difficulty through spawn rate scaling.

  - **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Move the player character horizontally.
- **Jumping:**
  - **Up Arrow / X Key:** Initiate a jump.
  - **Mid-air Direction Change:** Ability to change direction while in the air, similar to Mario's mechanics.
- **Block Manipulation:**
  - **Z Key:** Pick up or drop a block from the adjacent cell based on the direction the player is facing.
  - **Restrictions:**
    - **Carry Limit:** The player can carry only one block at a time.
    - **Mid-Air Interaction:** Players can pick up or drop blocks while jumping or falling.
- **Game Management:**
  - **P Key:** Pause the game.
  - **R Key:** Restart the game upon game over or during play.
  - **M Key:** Mute or unmute all game sounds.

### **c. Blocks**

- **Properties:**
  - **Size:** 1x1 tile (8x8 game-pixels).
  - **Colors and Numbers:**
    - **1:** Grey
    - **2:** Dark Brown
    - **3:** Light Brown
    - **4:** Orange
    - **5:** Red
    - **6:** Yellow
    - **7:** Dark Green
    - **8:** Lighter Green
    - **9:** Light Blue
    - **10:** Purple
- **Behavior:**
  - **Spawning:**
    - Blocks appear at predefined columns with an up arrow indicator.
    - Initial spawn interval of 5 seconds, decreasing linearly with the player's score until a minimum threshold.
  - **Falling:**
    - **Velocity:** Constant velocity; takes approximately 4-5 seconds to fall from the top to the bottom of the screen.
    - **Grid Interaction:** Blocks do not snap to the grid during the fall; snapping occurs upon landing.
  - **Merging:**
    - **Mechanism:** Two blocks of the same number merge into a higher-numbered block.
    - **Scoring:** Each merge triggers a 10-point score increment.
    - **Chain Reactions:** Multi-level merges occur almost instantaneously, allowing for chain reactions that cumulatively add points.
    - **Special Case:** Block 10 disappears after 2 seconds without merging.
  - **Interactions:**
    - **Obstruction:**
      - Blocks block the player's movement if occupying the adjacent cell.
      - Blocks landing on the player result in game over.
    - **Stacking Limits:**
      - Reaching the top of the playfield with stacked blocks results in game over.
  - **Disappearance Effects:**
    - When a block disappears due to merging, any blocks above it fall at the same velocity as blocks falling from the top.

### **d. Spawn Mechanics**

- **Spawn Rate Scaling:**
  - **Linear Increase:** Spawn frequency increases linearly as the player's score increases.
  - **Cap:** Spawn rate does not exceed a predefined minimum interval to prevent impossible game states.
- **Spawn Timing Parameters:**
  - **Initial Interval:** 5 seconds between spawns.
  - **Minimum Interval:** 1 second *(Final value to be confirmed based on playtesting)*.
- **Spawn Indicators:**
  - **Up Arrow:**
    - **Design:** 1-tile-sized upward-facing arrow.
    - **Duration:** Visible for approximately 1 second before the block spawns.
    - **Position:** Top of the intended spawn column.

### **e. Reticle Mechanics**

- **Purpose:** Indicates the block the player will interact with (pick up or drop).
- **Design:**
  - **Appearance:** A distinct, clearly visible UI element (e.g., a highlighted box or marker) adjacent to the player.
  - **Size:** 1x1 tile, consistent with block and player dimensions.
- **Behavior:**
  - **Placement:** Positioned in the grid cell directly next to the player based on the direction the player is facing (left or right).
  - **Snapping:** The reticle snaps to the block tile grid, ensuring precise alignment with potential target blocks.
  - **During Pickup:**
    - **Pickup Action:** When the player presses the Z key to pick up a block, the block in the reticle's position is lifted.
    - **Reticle Update:** The reticle shifts to show the destination cell where the block will be dropped.
    - **Visual Feedback:** The reticle remains visible in front of the player sprite, indicating where the block will be placed upon dropping.
- **Interactions:**
  - **Obstacle Avoidance:** The reticle does not obstruct the player's movement or actions.
  - **Dynamic Updates:** The reticle updates its position in real-time based on player movement and direction changes, including mid-air movements.

### **f. Scoring System**

- **Points Allocation:**
  - **Per Merge:** +10 points.
  - **Chain Reactions:** Each individual merge in the chain reaction awards an additional 10 points.
- **Score Display:**
  - **Format:** 6-digit display with leading zeros (e.g., 000012).
  - **Position:** Bottom of the screen, always visible.
- **High Score Tracking:**
  - **Storage:** Locally stored high score using browser storage (e.g., LocalStorage).
  - **Display:** Shown on the Game Over screen.

### **g. Game Progression**

- **Gameplay Type:** Endless, with increasing difficulty through spawn rate scaling.
- **Objective:** Achieve the highest possible score by merging blocks and preventing the playfield from filling up.
- **End Conditions:**
  - A block lands on the player.
  - Stacks of blocks reach the top of the playfield.
