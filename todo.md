- [ ] Set initial spawn interval to 5 seconds
- [ ] Implement spawn rate scaling based on the player's score, decreasing linearly down to a minimum of 1 second

### Step 4.3: Develop Block Falling Behavior
- [ ] Set constant falling velocity so blocks take ~4-5 seconds to fall from top to bottom
- [ ] Implement collision detection with the playfield floor and other blocks
- [ ] Snap blocks to the nearest 8x8 pixel grid upon landing
- [ ] Ensure blocks do not snap during fall and snapping occurs smoothly upon collision

### Step 4.4: Code Block Merging Logic
- [ ] Detect when two blocks of the same number collide or stack vertically
- [ ] Merge them into a single block with the next higher number
- [ ] Award 10 points per merge
- [ ] Update the score display in real-time
- [ ] Handle chain reactions by allowing multiple instantaneous merges
- [ ] Implement special case for block number 10 to disappear after 2 seconds if not merged

### Step 4.5: Implement Scoring System
- [ ] Award 10 points for each individual merge
- [ ] Accumulate points during chain reactions
- [ ] Update the 6-digit score display with leading zeros in real-time

## Phase 5: User Interface (UI) and HUD

### Step 5.1: Design Score Display
- [ ] Create a 6-digit retro-style score display with leading zeros
- [ ] Position the score display at the bottom of the screen
- [ ] Ensure the score updates dynamically as points are earned

### Step 5.2: Develop Reticle Indicator
- [ ] Implement a reticle adjacent to the player based on facing direction (left or right)
- [ ] Ensure the reticle snaps to the 8x8 pixel grid positions
- [ ] Indicate the target block for pickup or the drop location for placed blocks
- [ ] Update the reticle position dynamically with player movement and direction changes

- [ ] Allow resuming the game by pressing the P key again
- [ ] Enable restarting the game from the pause state using the R key

### Step 5.5: Create Game Over Screen
