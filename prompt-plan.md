```text
Create an asset loading system for "Open Stack House" using Haxe Flixel's asset management. In the Main Menu state, preload the necessary assets such as the game title image and the Start button graphic. Implement a `preload()` method that loads these assets. In the `create()` method, display a loading screen or progress bar that updates as assets are loaded. Once loading is complete, transition to the Main Menu interface displaying the game title and Start button.
```

---

### **Prompt 5: Design and Import Player Sprite Sheet**

```text
Design a retro-style, pixelated player character sprite sheet for "Open Stack House". The sprite sheet should include animations for idle, walking, and jumping states, with 2-3 frames each for smooth transitions. Import the sprite sheet into the `assets/graphics/` directory. Ensure that the sprite sheet is properly referenced in the asset loader, and verify that the animations are correctly sequenced by displaying the player character in the Gameplay state with idle animation playing by default.
```

---

### **Prompt 6: Implement Player Class with Movement**

```text
Create a `Player` class in the `src/` directory for "Open Stack House" extending `FlxSprite`. Initialize the player with the imported sprite sheet and set up animations for idle, walking, and jumping. Implement horizontal movement controls using the left and right arrow keys, ensuring the player can move within the playfield boundaries. Add collision detection to prevent the player from moving outside the designated 8x7 grid play area. Test the movement to ensure responsiveness and correct boundary enforcement.
```

---

### **Prompt 7: Develop Jumping Mechanics**

```text
Enhance the `Player` class in "Open Stack House" to include jumping mechanics. Allow the player to initiate a jump when the up arrow key or the X key is pressed. Set a consistent jump height that is unaffected by carrying blocks. Implement mid-air direction changes, enabling the player to switch horizontal movement direction while jumping or falling. Ensure that the jump animation plays correctly during the jump action and that the player returns to the idle or walking animation upon landing.
```

---

### **Prompt 8: Implement Block Class with Properties**

```text
Create a `Block` class in the `src/` directory for "Open Stack House" extending `FlxSprite`. Define properties such as `number` and `color`, assigning colors based on block numbers (1-10) as specified in the game design. Set the block size to 8x8 game-pixels and ensure that numbers are centered and legible on each block. Add animations or visual effects for merging and disappearing behaviors. Test the block instantiation by spawning a few blocks in the Gameplay state.
```

---

### **Prompt 9: Implement Block Spawning Logic**

```text
In the Gameplay state of "Open Stack House", implement the logic to spawn blocks at predefined columns. Each spawn should display an upward-facing arrow indicator at the top of the intended spawn column for approximately 1 second before the block appears. Set the initial spawn interval to 5 seconds, and implement a scaling mechanism that decreases the spawn interval linearly as the player's score increases, down to a minimum interval of 1 second. Ensure that blocks spawn correctly and adhere to the timing parameters.
```

---

### **Prompt 10: Develop Block Falling Behavior and Grid Snapping**

```text
Enhance the `Block` class in "Open Stack House" to include falling behavior. Set a constant falling velocity so that blocks take approximately 4-5 seconds to fall from the top to the bottom of the screen. Implement collision detection with the playfield floor and other blocks to determine landing points. Upon landing, snap the block to the nearest grid position (8x8 pixels). Ensure that blocks do not snap to the grid during the fall and that snapping occurs smoothly upon collision.
```

---

### **Prompt 11: Implement Block Merging Logic and Scoring**

```text
In "Open Stack House", implement the logic for merging blocks. When two blocks of the same number collide or occupy adjacent grid cells vertically, merge them into a single block with the next higher number. Upon merging, award the player 10 points and update the score display in real-time. Handle chain reactions by allowing multiple merges to occur almost instantaneously, each awarding additional points. For block number 10, implement a timer that causes the block to disappear after 2 seconds if it does not merge, without affecting the game state.
```

---

### **Prompt 12: Create User Interface Elements**

```text
Design and implement the User Interface (UI) elements for "Open Stack House". Create a 6-digit retro-style score display positioned at the bottom of the screen, ensuring it updates in real-time as points are earned. Develop the reticle indicator adjacent to the player character, reflecting the direction faced (left or right). The reticle should snap to the grid and indicate the target block for pickup or the drop location for placed blocks. Ensure that the UI elements are consistently styled with the retro pixelated aesthetic and do not obstruct gameplay.
```

---

### **Prompt 13: Develop Main Menu and Start Button Functionality**

```text
Design the Main Menu screen for "Open Stack House" with the game title displayed prominently in a pixelated font. Add a Start Game button that is clickable. Implement the functionality so that when the Start Game button is clicked, the game transitions from the Main Menu state to the Gameplay state. Ensure that the transition is smooth and that the Game Play state initializes correctly with necessary game elements in place.
```

---

### **Prompt 14: Implement Pause and Resume Functionality**

```text
In "Open Stack House", implement the pause functionality triggered by the P key. When the game is paused, display a pause symbol (e.g., a VCR-like icon) at the upper right corner of the screen without obstructing the view. Freeze all game actions, including player movement, block falling, and spawning intervals. Allow the player to resume the game by pressing the P key again, removing the pause symbol and restoring game activity. Ensure that the game can also be restarted from the pause state using the R key.
```

---

### **Prompt 15: Create Game Over Screen with High Score Display**

```text
Develop the Game Over screen for "Open Stack House". When the game ends due to a block landing on the player or stacks reaching the top, transition to the Game Over state. Display the text "Game Over" prominently, along with the player's final score and the high score retrieved from LocalStorage. If the player's score exceeds the current high score, update it in LocalStorage. Provide an instruction such as "Press R to Restart" for the player to initiate a new game. Ensure the Game Over screen maintains the retro aesthetic of the game.
```

---

### **Prompt 16: Integrate Sound Effects and Background Music**

```text
Integrate audio into "Open Stack House" using Haxe Flixel's audio capabilities. Import sound effects for jumping, picking up/dropping blocks, merging blocks, block landing, and game over actions into the `assets/audio/` directory. In the Gameplay state, trigger the corresponding sound effects based on player actions and block events. Additionally, add a looping upbeat background music track that plays during gameplay. Ensure that the background music loops seamlessly without noticeable gaps. Test all audio elements to confirm they play at appropriate times and volumes.
```

---

### **Prompt 17: Implement Mute/Unmute Functionality**

```text
Add the ability to mute and unmute all game sounds in "Open Stack House" using the M key. Implement an event listener for the M key that toggles the mute state. When muted, silence all sound effects and background music. When unmuted, restore all audio to their previous volumes. Ensure that the mute state persists during the game session and provides immediate feedback when toggled. Optionally, display a visual indicator of the mute state on the screen.
```

---

### **Prompt 18: Optimize Asset Loading and Performance**

```text
Optimize the asset loading process in "Open Stack House" by consolidating individual sprites into sprite sheets where applicable. Ensure that all sprite sheets are efficiently referenced in the code to minimize memory usage. Compress graphic and audio assets to reduce load times without compromising quality. Review and optimize the game loop and rendering processes to maintain a consistent 60 FPS across all supported browsers and devices.
